# IS LIVE ON TWITCH?

## Description:
"Is live on Twitch?" It's a desktop application that will send you a notification in case the streamer you have selected is live on Twitch.
For this creation I mainly used Python (and some usefull libraries), Winotify (python library that handles windows notifications) and Twitch API.

## How it works:
You type the name of your favorite streamer, and in case he/she is live, Windows will pop up a notification.
In case it is not live at the moment, the application will run in the background to send you the notification when the streamer has gone live on Twitch.
